This is an experimental repo where I'm familiarizing myself with using the [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html)
Architecture and [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/). I'm also trying out using [BaconJS](http://baconjs.github.io/) to get more familiar
with some functional reactive programming.

This sample is based off the demo from [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) as shown [here](https://egghead.io/technologies/react).

I may be doing things totally wrong or absolutely perfect, I have no way of
knowing yet.
